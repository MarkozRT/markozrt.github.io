    <p>Using the RLE function from a previous tutorial, the RLE function implements simplified Run Length Encoding compression of syntetic. Encoding of this variable operates on uint8 values. The function reshapes syntetic to a long vector then counts the numbers; if a new number is encountered, the count is stored and then is reset. There are 93050 8-bit symbols, with RLE encoding. RLE has INCREASED the length of the image, because syntetic contained no repetitions. RLE replaces each run of N adjacent pixels with the same value V with the pair {V,N}. In our case the number of bits has increased from 90000 symbols, the data has expanded, so it is NOT BETTER. However, if the are consecutive pixels with the same value it will reduce the number of bits, helping remove correlations, then man can reduce the data further. The compression efficiency of RLE for synthetic is 8.2711 bps (bits per symbol). This is calculated with the following code:</p>

    <p>The best method for the image picture is LZW and Huffman combined compression method.
      Comparing all the methods, it is clear that the LZW and Huffman combined method resulted in the
      best compression of 2.7948 bps. We have managed to compress picture below the entropy of the
      original representation. This method is not a lossy compression it is lossless compression. This
      method also reduces spatial redundancy the most effectively because with spatial redundancy
      some of the values do not ever change. There are many instances of these which repeat. It does
      not exploit coding redundancy as well because the picture image of type int8 has a minimum
      value of 0 and a maximum value of 252. These two values were calculated using the min and max
      functions within MATLAB. Now, the range of an 8 bit image is 0-255, with 256 different values,
      picture uses a range of 0-252, so most of the levels are used</p>

    <p>Image registration should minimise SSD (sum of square differences). NB two identical images that
      align should have SSD = 0. Registration should maximize NCC (Normalized cross-correlation);
      two aligned images with a linear relationship between intensities have NCC = 1. Registration
      should maximise MI (mutual information) as well. MI is suitable for images with different
      modalities. A global minimum point will be shown in very dark blue whilst a global maximum point
      will be shown in an area of very dark red. The only similarity measure that shows a clear point is
      MI which has a very clear, dark red area in the top left hand corner of the second subplot. You can
      see the maximum point at roughly [34,30]. With NCC no clear maximum is shown and with SSD
      there is no clear region for a minimum shown either. The range of blue in SSD is too large and the
      range of dark red is too large in NCC.</p>

    <p>The minimum value of SSD is 3.0185e+03, the maximum value for NCC is 0.4597 and the
      maximum value for MI is 2.6461. The corresponding translation parameters for SSD, MI and NCC
      are: [SSDminy1, SSDminx1] = [84,101], [MImaxy2, MImaxx2] = [30,30] and [NCCmaxy3,
      NCCmaxx3] = [48,8] . (Y coordinate comes first then x coordinate).</p>
